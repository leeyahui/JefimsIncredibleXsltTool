1.10

JEFIM'S INCREDIBLE XSLT TOOL 1.10

Sometimes they come back! Your good old XSLT tool dev team (me) is live again and ready to work those 
features in on an extremely unpredictible schedule. So, here is what's inside:

1. Transform your JSON documents using the brand new JUST engine! Transform them! Just do it!
2. Pretty print ACTUALLY does pretty print JSON documents (if JSON engine is selected)
3. Abosutely NO support for JSON highlighting (well, what did you expect? its a work in progress!)
4. SPlash screen updated to INform you of the new JSON feature
6. Some new ugly spagetti code introduced
7. 24kb of new library files! Nowadays you really appreciate when an app is not 500+ megs on your hard 
   drive so I am putting that as a feature.
8. On startup "only" 25 megs of RAM on my computer which is pretty rad. Flowdock is 135m and that's an 
   effing chat app! So you know, that is also a cool feature of this tool.
9. The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel series is a masterpiece. You'll thank me later.
10. Did you notice that #5 was missing?
	Yes) Good job! Keep on noticing stuff!
	No) Nou hätä, who cares anyway?
	Non-binary) ... what?..

This release was inspired by Tomi, a Moomin lollipop and indirectly by Jura who apparently made the 
FRENDS task using that JUST thingy.

Now lets forget about that clownsmanship and get to serious stuff. I urge everyone to use our github repo
for anything related to this tool. All PR-s are welcome and any feature requests are always a good thing.



1.11 - 1.12

1. Thanks to Tomi Ronimus we now have a must cleaner code base. The code does not make you nauseous
   right away anymore, which is really nice.
2. Syntax concoctions removed completely, as it was a feature that noone actually used. All hail Tomi!
3. I cannot anymore be the only one whose name is mentioned in the software, so I made a contributors
   window! Access it from the file menu! Try it out - its great!
3. Main UI had a visually minor facelift.
4. We all live in the age of dark themes and Jefim's Incredible XSLT Tool is probably the last
   product in the world to introduce its dark theme! But its here! A dark theme for all of us to enjoy!
   Here is an exhaustive list of all themes currenty included: VS Light and VS Dark.
5. If some of you hoped that there is support for externally loadable themes - hope no more! There is
   no such thing. You can, however, clone the repo, add your theme in code and submit
   a PR - it is pretty easy!
6. Auto-closing XML/HTML tags! Just type </ and the tool with complete it with a tag! Yay!
